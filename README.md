How to transform a circle into a wing profile

The Joukovski transformation is a complex function that transforms a circle into a wing profile.

Complex function are an amazing tool in math. 

The coordinates x and y of a point are used to define a complex number (x+iy). Complex number can be plotted by using the real value on the x-axis and the y value on the y-axis.

When applying a complex function to (x+iy), we obtain a new complex number (x'+iy') that can be then plotted and you usually obtain a transformed version of the plot you orginally had.

This code is going to show you how the Joukovski transformation convert a circle into a wing profil. There are three parameters to take into account :
  - The two coordinates of the center of the circle
  - "a" a constant
